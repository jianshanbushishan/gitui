# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Unreleased

### Added
* the `bat` file preview and the `delta` diff renderer now follow the Windows light/dark system theme. At startup gitui reads the `AppsUseLightTheme` registry value (which Windows Terminal mirrors when its `theme` is `system`, the default). Because both tools are launched with piped stdout and cannot query the terminal themselves, gitui passes `light`/`dark` to bat and `--light`/`--dark` plus true-color output to delta. This keeps bat's automatic syntax-theme choice and delta's complete palette (including addition/deletion backgrounds) consistent with direct terminal execution. The scheme is detected once at launch, so switching the OS theme requires reopening gitui. On macOS/Linux the detection returns "unknown" and the tools retain their previous behavior.
* xterm palette colors 16–255 emitted by external preview tools are expanded to their exact RGB values before rendering. This prevents the Windows crossterm path from reducing bat's 256-color syntax output to the nearest 16-color terminal entry (for example, bat color 197 `#ff005f` previously appeared as the terminal's pale bright red), making gitui's preview match direct bat output.
* external preview-tool discovery now honors Windows `PATHEXT`. Previously gitui searched PATH for the literal extensionless names `bat`/`batcat`/`eza`; Scoop installs `bat.exe`, so Windows silently fell back to the built-in Syntect highlighter even though running `bat` directly worked. BAT startup and exit failures are now also recorded in the debug log.

## [v2.15] - 2026-07-22

### Added
* pressing `e` in the diff view now jumps the external editor to the source line under the cursor (e.g. `nvim +42 file.rs`) instead of merely opening the file. The cursor's new-file line number is resolved through the diff data model — `delta_line_positions` in delta mode, and flattened hunk lines in unified mode, with side-by-side `Delete`+`Add` pairing handled — and carried through the `OpenExternalEditor` queue event to the editor launcher, which inserts a `+n` argument between the editor's own args and the path (the vi/vim/emacs/nano convention). Sites without line-number context (file trees, the commit message editor) pass `None` and behave as before, and it falls back to no `+n` when the line has no new-file number (hunk header, pure delete line, or binary diff).

### Fixed
* the version baked into the binary via `GITUI_BUILD_NAME` no longer sticks at a stale `git describe` value. `build.rs` only declared `rerun-if-changed=build.rs`, so Cargo never re-ran the build script when git state (tag/commit/branch) changed while `build.rs` itself stayed unchanged. It now also declares `rerun-if-changed=.git/HEAD`, so commit/checkout/tag movement — which rewrites `.git/HEAD` — triggers a fresh `git describe`.

### Changed
* the `(+N -M)` line-stats overlays on the Staged and Unstaged panes are now computed off the UI thread via a new `AsyncLineStats` worker. Previously `get_staged_line_stats` / `get_unstaged_line_stats` ran the single whole-repo bulk diff on the UI thread (the v2.14 optimization made each call ~3.9× faster but still synchronous on every status refresh). `AsyncLineStats` computes both staged and unstaged totals together in one background `rayon` job, keyed by `DiffOptions` plus a generation counter (mirroring `AsyncStatus`), so toggling e.g. `ignore_whitespace` raises a fresh request and the displayed `(+.. -..)` follows — and a stale in-flight result never satisfies a newer request. The UI thread no longer blocks on diff stats.

## [v2.14] - 2026-07-21

### Added
* focusing a folder in the Files tab (and the revision-files popup) now renders the preview as a depth-limited tree instead of the flat `-l -h` long listing, which was too wide for the half-width pane. When `eza` is available the preview runs `eza --tree --color=always --level=N` (names + branch glyphs only); the plain-`ls` fallback stays flat since `ls` has no tree mode. The depth `N` is configurable via the new `preview_tree_depth` option in `config.ron` (default `2`, clamped to `[1, 10]`). An empty directory argument (the repo root arrives as `""` after `./` stripping) is normalized to `.` so focusing the root shows the repo tree instead of erroring out.

### Fixed
* the file-history popup title now shows a 1-based position. It previously read `Revisions of 'Cargo.toml' (0/310)` on the first revision and `(310/310)` on the last because `get_title()` fed two 0-based indices into `file_log_title()`: the raw selected index and `get_max_selection()` (`count().saturating_sub(1)`, i.e. the last item's index, not the total). A new `get_revisions_count()` returns the real `AsyncLog::count()` total, and the selected position is now `selected + 1` clamped to `[1, total]` (`0` when empty) — so it reads `(1/311)` at the first revision and `(311/311)` at the last. Scroll clamping still uses `get_max_selection()` unchanged.

### Changed
* the Status tab no longer lags when navigating the file list. `get_staged_line_stats` and `get_unstaged_line_stats` previously folded over every changed file by calling `get_diff()` → `raw_diff_to_file_diff()` per file, building a full `FileDiff` (all hunks + lines, with string allocations) on the UI thread purely to count `+`/`-` lines — and the unstaged pass added in v2.12 doubled that cost on every status refresh. Both now run a single whole-repo diff (no pathspec) and read `git2::Diff::stats()` for insertions/deletions, skipping the hunk/line parsing entirely. `get_staged_line_stats` uses one `diff_tree_to_index`; `get_unstaged_line_stats` uses one `diff_index_to_workdir` without `include_untracked` (so new files stay excluded, matching the old `StatusItemType::New` skip). Diff-option semantics (context / ignore-whitespace / interhunk) are unchanged and, like the old per-file path, `find_similar` is not called. Benchmark (`bench_unstaged_line_stats`): 80 files × 60-line changes, median of 5 runs — old per-file fold ~58 ms, new bulk-stats ~15 ms (~3.9× faster).

## [v2.13] - 2026-07-15

### Added
* the focused Files pane in the commit details panel (and the fullscreen `InspectCommit` popup) now shows a scrollbar when its content overflows, matching the scrollbars already present on the focused `Message` and `Info` panes. `status_tree` renders the scrollbar only while the Files pane holds focus, so the unfocused state stays clean.
* focusing a folder in the Files tab (and the revision-files popup) now shows a directory listing in the preview instead of leaving the previously-selected file's content on screen. The preview runs `eza --group -l -h --color=always`, falling back to GNU `ls -l --color=always` or BSD `ls -l -G` (with `CLICOLOR_FORCE=1`), in the repo working dir and renders the colored output through the existing ANSI pipeline. Applies to both `FilesTab` and `RevisionFilesPopup` since they share `RevisionFilesComponent`.
* selecting a file no longer flashes plain text before the highlighted output appears when `bat` is available. `load_file` probes bat availability (a cheap `PATH` scan) and, when bat is present, shows a blank placeholder until the async highlight job produces the colored result — so the pane goes blank→highlighted with no plain-text flash. Without bat, behavior is unchanged (plain placeholder while syntect runs).

### Fixed
* clippy now passes on current stable Rust, unblocking the CD pipeline. Newer clippy (stable 1.97) flagged two classes of lint across `asyncgit` and the main crate: `useless_borrows_in_formatting` for `&`-prefixed args passed to `format!`/`trace!` (`&remote_name`, `&self.program`, `&repo`, `&e.msg`, `&item_path`) and `manual_clear` for `.truncate(0)` calls. The redundant borrows were dropped, the simple format args inlined (`{remote_name}`, `{repo:?}`, `{item_path}/`), and the `.truncate(0)` calls replaced with `.clear()`, so `make clippy` is clean again.

## [v2.12] - 2026-07-06

### Added
* the Unstaged pane now mirrors the Staged pane's line-count display: `(+N -M)` totals across unstaged tracked files, rendered before the branch info as `(+194 -13) (mymaster ↑3 ↓0)`. Untracked files are excluded so the count reflects only changes to files git already tracks. Backed by a new `get_unstaged_line_stats` helper that sums add/delete lines over `get_diff(..., stage=false)`.
* the commit popup now accepts `shift+enter` and `alt+enter` as newlines, in addition to the configured `newline` key. Previously `shift+enter` didn't work: kitty maps it to `\e\r`, which crossterm decodes as `Alt+Enter` without the kitty keyboard protocol enabled. `ctrl+enter` is intentionally excluded.
* the commit popup now persists the in-progress message and cursor position to the per-repo options file (`.git/gitui/`) on `c-q` close, external-editor open, and `Ctrl-C` hard exit, restoring both on next open — even across gitui restarts. Clearing happens on successful commit or when the user empties the text and closes. Only Normal-mode commits are tracked; Reword, Amend, Merge, and Revert keep their own message sources. The new `commit_draft` / `commit_draft_cursor` fields are optional, so older options files without them deserialize to `None` with no migration.
* the file-history preview (`SyntaxTextComponent`, used by the Files tab and the revision-files popup) now shows bat line numbers via `--style=plain,numbers` instead of `--plain`. A new `line_numbers` flag is threaded through `AsyncSyntaxJob` into `try_bat`; blame keeps its own line column and leaves the flag off.

### Fixed
* deleted files now render in the delta diff preview instead of showing "No delta output available." `git diff <path>` failed with "ambiguous argument" for deleted tracked files because git parsed the path as a revision; passing `--` to separate paths from revisions (matching the Commit/Commits branches) fixes the WorkDir and Stage paths.

## [v2.11] - 2026-07-01

### Added
* the commit details panel now has a 3-way focus cycle: `Info` → `Message` → `Files` (via `move_up`/`move_down`, stop at ends). Previously only `Message` and `Files` were focusable. The `Info` pane grows from 8 to 12 rows when focused (fitting all 7 content lines + border), gains its own scrollbar, and `y` on the `Info` pane copies the full `Author`/`Date`/`Sha`/`Tags` block to the clipboard. The copy text is extracted from the same `get_text_info` lines used to render, so it always matches the display. The fullscreen `InspectCommit` popup (right-arrow) now opens focused on `Files` instead of `Message`.
* copy-success popups now show a green `Copied Text:` label line above the copied content, instead of inlining `Copied Text "..."` into the body. The label uses the theme's green (`commit_author`); the body stays in normal text. A new `ShowInfoLabeledMsg(label, body)` queue variant backs this; tag-annotation popups keep their plain single-color appearance.

### Fixed
* the author column in the commit list is now a fixed width (`AUTHOR_WIDTH = 18`) instead of being derived from pane width (`(width - 19) / 3` clamped to [3, 20]). Opening the right details pane (which shrinks the list) no longer thins the author→message gap — the gap stays stable regardless of pane state.

### Changed
* the `Tags:` section in the commit details Info pane now shows the label and all tag names on a single line (`Tags:  v2.10, v2.9`), separated by `, `. Previously the label sat alone on its own line and tag names were packed onto a separate line joined by `,` (no space), wasting a row and reading awkwardly for a single tag. The `copy_info` output follows automatically since it extracts from the same rendered lines.

## [v2.10] - 2026-06-30

### Added
* the Staged and Unstaged panes now show overlays on their top borders: the Staged pane shows `(+N -M)` line additions/deletions totals computed by folding over all staged `FileDiff`s, and the Unstaged pane shows the current branch with ahead/behind counts. Both overlays are always visible regardless of focus, replacing the previous focus-dependent branch display.

### Fixed
* info/error message popups (e.g. the copy-complete popup) no longer have their left/right borders visually overwritten by wide (CJK/emoji) graphemes. `MsgPopup::draw` now renders via `ui::render_block_text` (`Buffer::set_line`, which resets wide-char trailing cells) and clears a 1-cell margin around the popup so a wide grapheme sitting just outside the popup area cannot visually overflow into the border cells — the same two-layer fix previously applied to `ConfirmPopup` and the text-input popups.

## [v2.9] - 2026-06-30

### Added
* `e` (edit file) and `c` (commit) now work when the diff pane is focused, not just when the file tree is focused. `DiffComponent` handles `edit_file` by opening the currently shown file in the external editor, and `Status::can_commit` no longer requires stage focus — so `c` works from WorkDir, Stage, or fullscreen-Diff focus whenever there are staged changes. The `edit_file` key also works in the InspectCommit, CompareCommits, and FileRevlog popup fullscreen diffs.
* syntax highlighting now prefers `bat` when available, parsing its ANSI output through the existing `ansi_to_lines` pipeline. Falls back to the built-in syntect highlighter if `bat` is absent or fails, so behavior is unchanged on systems without it. `bat` reads `$BAT_THEME` itself, so users get their preferred theme with no extra wiring. Searches `PATH` for `bat` then `batcat` (Debian rename) with no new dependency.

### Fixed
* pressing `y` in the Revlog split view (left=commit list, right=inline details) now copies the commit **hash** instead of the message. The inline details panel no longer auto-focuses the message pane on open — focus stays on the commit list. To copy the commit message, open the fullscreen `InspectCommit` popup (right-arrow), which focuses the message pane.
* centered text-input popups (commit, stash-message, rename branch/tag, etc.) no longer have their left border visually overwritten by a wide (CJK/emoji) grapheme in the diff content sitting just outside the popup. `TextInputComponent::draw` now clears a 1-cell margin around the popup area for non-embed cases, matching the `ConfirmPopup` fix — the same Layer-2 root cause documented in the wide-char border overflow notes.

## [v2.8] - 2026-06-29

### Added
* the diff panel title now shows per-file line additions/deletions as `(+added -deleted)` next to the file path, e.g. `Diff: src/components/diff.rs (+12 -3) [1/5]`. Counts are derived from `DiffLineType::Add`/`Delete` over all hunks and update on every render from the same `FileDiff` as the hunk indicator, so they stay in sync with stage/unstage and delta preview refreshes. Side-by-side mode appends the same indicator to the `[Old]`/`[New]` titles. Empty (no add/delete) diffs omit the counter.

### Fixed
* `sync::submodules::tests::test_smoke` no longer breaks local/offline test runs. The test clones a real GitHub repo (`extrawurst/brewdump`), so it failed whenever the network was unavailable. It is now marked `#[ignore = "requires network access to github.com"]` — skipped by default, still runnable via `cargo test -- --ignored test_smoke` when online.

## [v2.7] - 2026-06-26

### Fixed
* reset hunk now works in delta preview mode. The `!is_delta_preview()` guard on the `status_reset_item` keybinding has been removed — `selected_hunk` and the hunk header hash are both maintained correctly in delta mode (via the `delta_line_hunks` mapping), so reset hunk runs the same way as stage/unstage hunk, which was already unguarded.
* wide (CJK/emoji) graphemes no longer visually overflow `Block` borders in the diff view and popups. `ratatui` 0.29's `Paragraph::render_text` writes a wide grapheme with `Cell::set_symbol` but does not reset the trailing cell it occupies, so the next cell's symbol (including a border glyph) gets overwritten on the terminal. The diff component (`draw_delta`, `draw_side_by_side`, unified path) and the confirm/checkout-option/reset/options/copy-path/external-editor popups now render via `Buffer::set_line` (through `ui::render_lines` / `ui::render_block_text`), which resets the trailing cell and drops graphemes wider than the remaining width. The confirm popup additionally clears a 1-cell margin around itself so a wide grapheme sitting just outside the popup area cannot visually overflow into the popup's border cells.

## [v2.6] - 2026-06-24

### Added
* commit details message view: pressing `y` while the message window is focused (inline panel opened via `Enter` in Revlog, or the InspectCommit popup via `→`) copies the full commit message (subject + body) to the clipboard. The Revlog list's `y` (copy hash) is unaffected since the message window has its own focus state. Adds a "Copy Message" command-bar label.

### Fixed
* delta diff preview no longer starts with a spurious empty row. Delta always emits a blank line before the first hunk separator; leading empty lines are now stripped from the parsed output so the preview begins with the separator box.

## [v2.5] - 2026-06-24

### Added
* Copy Path popup (`Shift+Y`) now has a `Content` option that copies a selected file's entire contents to the clipboard. The option is shown only for files (hidden for directories and binary/unreadable files). In the revision files tree, content is read from the git revision; in the status tree, from the working tree.

### Fixed
* delta diff preview in non-side-by-side mode no longer clips the tail of wrapped lines for CJK/full-width text. Line wrapping, the trailing-whitespace trim threshold, and background padding now use unicode display width (`unicode-width`) instead of `chars().count()`, so CJK characters (2 terminal cells each) produce the correct number of wrapped rows that match what ratatui renders — fixing the "3 rows became 2" truncation in narrow previews. Adds a CJK reproduction test.

## [v2.4] - 2026-06-23

### Fixed
* `test_delta_preserves_cursor_on_content_change` no longer fails on CI runners without the `delta` binary installed — the test now skips cleanly when `delta` is not on `PATH` instead of asserting on `is_delta_preview()` after `toggle_diff_mode()` resets to `Unified`. Unblocks the CD release pipeline.

## [v2.3] - 2026-06-23

### Fixed
* delta diff mode no longer loses cursor position or flickers "Loading..." after stage/unstage hunk or stage/unstage lines — same-file content changes now render synchronously via `AsyncDelta::request_sync`, while file switches keep the async path to avoid blocking the event loop. Also stops `request_delta()` from clearing `delta_display_lines` on cache miss, so the previous output stays visible during background re-renders.

## [v2.2] - 2026-06-22

### Fixed
* delta diff preview in the Status tab no longer shows stale content after stage/unstage hunk, stage/unstage lines, reset hunk, or external file edits — the async delta cache key now includes the `FileDiff` hash, so any content change invalidates the cached render even when `path`/`diff_type`/`width` are unchanged

## [v1.5] - 2026-06-18

### Changed
* search result navigation: `j`/`k`, `g`/`G` and page up/down now walk every commit instead of being locked to matches; `ctrl+n`/`ctrl+p` still jumps between matches with wrap-around, and now jumps from the actual cursor position to the nearest match
* `ctrl+n`/`ctrl+p` centers the target commit in the viewport when it is off-screen instead of pinning it to the top/bottom row
* search status line now reflects the cursor's position in the match range (`0/N` before the first match through `N/N` on the last)
* ask for confirmation before pushing tags from the revlog and taglist popup, and before branch push from the status tab (force push already asked)
* cache mailmap per thread during commit search, avoiding a `repo.mailmap()` stat per commit — major speedup on NFS-backed repositories

### Fixed
* selected row keeps its background on non-highlighted commits while a search is active
* `g`/`G` (home/end) now work in search-highlighted commit list instead of being a no-op when the cursor is on a non-matching commit
* `j`/`k` in the log search popup now type into the search box instead of moving the option cursor

## [0.26.3] - 2024-06-02

### Breaking Changes

#### Theme file format

**note:** this actually applied to the previous release already: `0.26.2`

Ratatui (upstream terminal rendering crate) changed its serialization format for Colors. So the theme files have to be adjusted.

`selection_fg: Some(White)` -> `selection_fg: Some("White")`

but this also allows us now to define colors in the common hex format:

`selection_fg: Some(Rgb(0,255,0))` -> `selection_fg: Some("#00ff00")`

** multiline text editor **

![multiline editor](assets/multiline-texteditor.gif)

** syntax highlighting in blame **

![syntax-highlighting-blame](assets/syntax-highlighting-blame.png)

### Breaking Change

#### commit key binding

The Commit message popup now supports multiline editing! Inserting a **newline** defaults to `enter`. This comes with a new default to confirm the commit message (`ctrl+d`).
Both commands can be overwritten via `newline` and `commit` in the key bindings. see [KEY_CONFIG](./KEY_CONFIG.md) on how.
These defaults require some adoption from existing users but feel more natural to new users.

#### key binding bitflags

Modifiers like `SHIFT` or `CONTROL` are no longer configured via magic bitflags but via strings thanks to changes in the [bitflags crate](https://github.com/bitflags/bitflags/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#changes-to-serde-serialization) we depend on. Please see [KEY_CONFIG.md](./KEY_CONFIG.md) or [vim_style_key_config.ron](./vim_style_key_config.ron) for more info and examples.

### Added

![fuzzy-find](assets/fuzzy-find-matches.gif)

### Breaking Change
Have you used `key_config.ron` for custom key bindings before?
The way this works got changed and simplified ([See docs](https://github.com/gitui-org/gitui/blob/master/KEY_CONFIG.md) for more info):
* You only define the keys that should differ from the default.
* The file is renamed to `key_bindings.ron`
